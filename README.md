## Rowing-Website

I was in charge of re-vamping the rowing website over the summer of 2014. I cleaned up the code, added in my own css and java-script features, and made links and pictures current. This website is no longer in use. The current one is here: https://www.colorado.edu/sportsclub/crew/
