<p>Thank you for stopping by the University of Colorado Crew's website. We have established ourselves as one of the largest club sports at the University and continually attract some of the best student-athletes. We are looking for individuals that desire competition, a strong team dynamic, rigorous training, and fun. We train hard and compete against some of the best programs in the country. We are proud to represent the University of Colorado together in a sport that is internationally recognized and supported.
<br></br>
Rowing is defined by hard work, dedication, and teamwork. From the first stroke at practice until the time we collapse into bed, the goal at Colorado Crew is to achieve excellence. Whether that be on the water, in the classroom, or in our personal lives, rowers will succeed and excel. The commitment and dedication required to be a successful student-athlete gives each member skills he or she will use to succeed in life.
<br></br>
Colorado Crew began in the fall of 1992 when two transfer students from the University of San Diego wanted to row for a school that had no rowing team. Over the years the team has grown larger and larger, won more regattas, and has become more and more prestigious at the national level. The past several years have seen some of the fastest boats in team history, with top-5 places at national-level regattas such as the Head of the Charles, the Western IRA Championships and the American Collegiate Rowing Association Championships. Today we have a young team with loads of talent and a lot of potential. Just this past 2012-13 season, the women's novice 8 boat took 3rd in the nation for club sports and the men's novice 8 took 4th. We are looking forward to seeing these young individuals continue to prove themselves on the race course!
